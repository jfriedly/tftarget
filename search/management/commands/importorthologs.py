"""
This file contains a command to import a spreadsheet of orthologs. It can
handle any arbitrary number of species in the import sheet (even though only
two are currently used) as long as they are in the order specified by the
ALL_SPECIES value in _constants and the appropriate tables have been added to
the Gene table. If species are added, you'll also need to change the front end
appropriately. It'll be a lot of work, but none of it in here.
