In general, there are two kinds of experiments that associate a transcription factor with a gene target.
These are listed below.
In order to return results for a transcription factor search, we need to meet a few minimum qualifications:

* At least one experiment from each category

* A minimum total score from the experiments matching the factor OR at least two experiments from each category


Binding Experiments
-------------------

* ChIP

* ChIP-qPCR (or possibly ChIP-q-PCR)

* ChIP-PCR

* ChIP-chip

* ChIP-seq

* EMSA

Gene Expression Experiments
---------------------------

* Reporter gene assay

* Western blot

* Northern blot

* PCR

* q-PCR

* RT-PCR

* Microarray

* RNA-seq

* Nuclear run-on

* Nuclear run-off
