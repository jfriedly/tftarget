Search Algorithm
----------------

In general, there are two kinds of experiments that associate a transcription factor with a gene target.
These are listed below.
In order to return results for a transcription factor search, we need to meet a few minimum qualifications:

* At least one experiment from each category

* A minimum total score from the experiments matching the factor OR at least two experiments from each category


Binding Experiments
'''''''''''''''''''

* ChIP

* ChIP-qPCR (or possibly ChIP-q-PCR)

* ChIP-PCR

* ChIP-chip

* ChIP-seq

* EMSA

Gene Expression Experiments
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Reporter gene assay

* Western blot

* Northern blot

* PCR

* q-PCR

* RT-PCR

* Microarray

* RNA-seq

* Nuclear run-on

* Nuclear run-off


Transcription Factor Families
-----------------------------

Currently, we have data that only shows two transcription factor families, E2F and Myc.
This semester, we'll be getting three new transcription families, NFkB, FOX, and STAT.
Within each of these, there are a number of transcription factors that we're looking at, which are shown below.
Note that capitalization varies between the data and the values here.
